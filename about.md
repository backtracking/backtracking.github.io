My name is Jean-Christophe Filli√¢tre.

I'm an enthusiastic programmer since 1984 (I was 13). My first
computer was a [Thomson
TO7/70](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomson_TO7/70), on which I used
to code in Basic and [6809
assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_6809).  In 1986, I
switched to an [Atari 520 ST](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_ST),
on which I used to code in [GFA
Basic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GFA_BASIC) and in [68000
assembly](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_68000). In the early
1990s, I progressively moved to PC. Today, I code mostly in
[OCaml](http://ocaml.org/), under Linux. A few years ago, I discovered
[Project Euler](http://www.projecteuler.net/); if you like mathematics
and programming, you'll love it.

In real life, I'm doing research in Computer Science. See [my academic webpage](https://www.lri.fr/~filliatr/) for more details.

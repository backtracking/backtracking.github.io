In real life, I'm doing research in Computer Science. See [my academic webpage](https://www.lri.fr/~filliatr/) for more details.

## OCaml software

I'm (co)author of several OCaml libraries and programs, listed below.

### with opam packages

* libraries
  * graph library: [OCamlGraph](https://github.com/backtracking/ocamlgraph)
  * bit vectors: [bitv](https://github.com/backtracking/bitv)
  * flexible arrays: [flex-array](https://github.com/backtracking/flex-array)
  * priority queues: [bheap](https://github.com/backtracking/bheap)
  * Patricia trees: [ptset](https://github.com/backtracking/ptset) and
    [ptmap](https://github.com/backtracking/ptmap)
  * [Combine](https://github.com/backtracking/combine) (with Remy El Sibaïe)
  * distributed computing, a la map-reduce: [Functory](https://github.com/backtracking/functory) (with Kalyan Krishnamani)
  * hash-consing: [hashcons](https://github.com/backtracking/ocaml-hashcons)
  * BDD: [bdd](https://github.com/backtracking/ocaml-bdd)
  * hash sets: [hashset](https://github.com/backtracking/hashset)
* programs
  * [bibtex2html](https://github.com/backtracking/bibtex2html) (with
    Claude Marché)
  * [mlpost](https://github.com/backtracking/mlpost) (with Romain
